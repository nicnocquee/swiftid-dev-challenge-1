# SwiftID.dev Challenge 1

## About

In this first challenge, you need to create a list of jokes where each joke will show the punchline whenever user taps on it.

## Requirement

✅ Must use SwiftUI.

✅ Each of the row shows the joke's `setup` text.

✅ When a joke is tapped, it _must show_ the `punchline` under the joke's `setup` _with animation._

✅ When a `punchline` is being shown, the next joke _must animate_ to its new position.

✅ When a joke with a visible `punchline` is tapped, it must hide the `punchline` with animation.

✅ When a `punchline` is being hidden, the next joke _must animate_ to its new position.
